I let that soak for about an hour and then used a bristle brush to clean away the grease from each piece. This took several washings and about 15 - 20 minutes of effort. After this, I took bicarbonate of soda spray and sprayed that on each of the components and again took the bristle brush to clean through it. Once these were clean, I placed them aside and started on the cooker hood. I used the pink stuff to try to cut away at some of the grease - but first wet the hood slightly before placing that on. I left that for a few hours and then came back - again with a basin of hot water, dish soap and vinegar. I used both the bristle brush and a number of jay cloths to clean the outside of the hood, but I realised the inside of the hood was also filthy and I cleaned that out using several jay clothes. Once that was clean to a satisfactory level, I sprayed with bicarbonate of soda and scrubbed a little more and then finished off with an antibacterial wipe around the entire hood.",2.522,2.522,210.469,1,panicked,desire,insisting,fantasizing,preoccupied,regretful,sceptical,anticipating,accusing,contemplative,thoughtful,doubtful,arrogant,preoccupied,pensive,hostile,arrogant,interested,impatient,serious,distrustful,suspicious,Contact Wai-Hin and arrange to catch up but also make friends with her replacement.,13.715,13.715,15.064,1,Talk to his boss or the management about it.,14.336,14.336,16.665,1,Concentrate on doing his work well at the new job.,12.18,12.18,13.388,1,"He should make the effort to contact them, but also try to meet people in his new city.",43.934,45.786,46.817,2,Spend time listening and getting involved again.,8.407,8.407,9.159,1,"Set up a system for staying in touch, like weekly phone calls or emails.",0.22,40.75,42.664,2,Let herself cry and express emotion for as long as she feels like.,7.581,7.581,8.977,1,"Understand that relationships change, but keep calling him from time to time.",101.321,101.321,102.279,1,Tell her sister-in-law these comments upset her.,78.317,78.317,79.736,1,Find out what is happening and discuss his concerns with his family.,9.234,9.234,10.298,1,"Talk to her workmates, try to create social contacts and make friends.",26.788,26.788,28.337,1,Talk to her friends or workmates about it.,22.835,22.835,24.968,1,"Invite Blair again, maybe rescheduling for another time.",10.276,10.276,11.643,1,"Make sure she keeps in contact through email, phone or letter writing.",8.085,8.085,9.249,1,Explain the lack of resources to her boss or to management.,11.446,11.446,18.561,1,Realize that children develop at different rates.,24.746,24.746,26.339,1,Find out if there is some reasonable explanation for the shift changes.,7.365,7.365,8.71,1,"Understand that people change, so move on, but remember the good times.",9.074,9.074,10.004,1,day,2.444,2.444,4.423,1,coat,13.215,13.215,15.094,1,,24.728,24.728,30.111,1,,29.712,29.712,29.717,1,silver,6.896,6.896,8.514,1,can,19.874,19.874,21.752,1,party,7.079,7.079,9.526,1,night,3.155,3.155,16.749,1,,19.511,19.511,19.515,1,,7.294,27.413,27.415,2,,3.123,21.406,21.408,2,black,4.991,4.991,9.085,1,,1.886,26.97,26.972,3,night,3.343,5.993,6.64,2,coffee,7.091,7.091,11.403,1,,4.053,25.486,25.488,3,,2.205,18.706,18.709,2,face,11.184,11.184,12.448,1,,19.316,19.316,19.319,1,,2.173,21.524,21.527,3,,2.281,21.2,21.202,2,28.634,28.634,29.849,1,Participation in art courses increases students creative thinking in their science and technology courses.,24.846,24.846,29.496,1,£117.00,21.306,21.306,22.487,1,"1-D, 2-A, 3-C, 4-B",61.332,61.332,62.53,1,S,2.331,6.08,20.191,3,IEWS,Neither happy nor unhappy

He has to have it twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. I tend to try and do it before his meal times to make it more of a routine. In each case, I will take the little plastic syringe and slot it into the specialised neck of the thyronorm bottle. The bottle is dark brown to protect the active ingredients from the sunlight. I then invert both bottle and syringe, and draw out a quantity of liquid. I cannot remember what this amount is off of the top of my head, but I have wrapped some red electrical insulating tape around the syringe which indicates the exact quantity needed. The use of electrical insulating tape always make me giggle, it has become a bit of a running joke in our family that we never have standard sellotape. At least in this case it is much more useful as it provides a good visual marker. Once I have this amount, I right the bottle and remove the syringe. My cat recognises the syringe and knows what's coming, but he is never afraid or nervous. Even before this became such a routine, it never really bothered him as he is so gentle and trusting. I let him sit down, and will either sit next to him or kneel, place my hand under his chin and gently put the syringe in his mouth. I will slowly push the plunger of the syringe and allow the liquid to enter his mouth, waiting between licks. I like to give him lots of love and praise, but I think that is pretty standard in our relationship! The whole injecting process takes less than 5 seconds, and afterwards I take the syringe to the sink and rinse it, ready to be reused next time. I then tick off that I've given him the medication on my tick sheet, as I can be quite forgetful and often worry that I've forgotten to medicate him or accidentally double dose him.

I had such a lovely time from the minute we got to the airport to the minute we got home. 
One of the nicest things about the trip was the amount of time we spent relaxing on the beach. 
Each day we would head to the beach to relax in the warm sun and swim in the sea. When it got to lunch time we would walk down to a little restaurant located on the beach. There we would eat pizza and drink sangria. I can still remember how lovely the food tasted. Then afterwards we would head back to our sun loungers feeling a little bit tiddly and tired but very very relaxed. We would then fall asleep listening to the sea. I loved the feel of burrowing into the sand, it was so so lovely. 
Then as the sun started to go down we would have another dip in the sea before heading back to get ready to go out to dinner. 
I think this was holiday was the nicest I have ever been on, and I’ve been on a lot, but probably the simplest one.

It was a secret I’d been keeping for a whole year and I wanted it to be magical. The planning process of course was so much fun, but the main part of the excitement for me was revealing the surprise. I’d enlisted the help of one of their favourites YouTubers and asked if she’d kindly make them a special video (disguised as one of her usual videos). I remember being poorly in bed, eagerly anticipating the video to land in my inbox. I watched with joy as she nailed the perfect reveal video and I cried with joy. As the day approached I was giddy. Giggling when no one was watching and smiling constantly. On the morning, we sat them down in front of the tv and secretly filmed their reaction. They were both in complete shock. I cried more joyful tears and soaked in their reactions.

We were split into separate rooms as guys so I got the chance to know them better since we were sharing a room.,2.556,488.094,489.333,9,,,,,,,,,,panicked,desire,insisting,fantasizing,preoccupied,regretful,sceptical,anticipating,accusing,contemplative,thoughtful,playful,tentative,preoccupied,hostile,hostile,cautious,interested,reflective,serious,distrustful,suspicious,"Spend time getting to know the other people in the office, and strike up new friendships.",30.135,30.135,32.621,1,Carefully consider his options and discuss it with his family.,23.169,28.185,29.599,3,Concentrate on doing his work well at the new job.,13.778,13.778,16.954,1,"Let go of his old friends, who have shown themselves to be unreliable.",18.714,18.714,20.001,1,Tell his family he feels left out.,2.94,32.661,32.843,9,Realize he shouldn’t have applied for the job if he didn’t want to leave.,19.068,19.068,21.217,1,Visit the hospital and ask staff about their condition.,17.871,17.871,20.599,1,Realize that he is growing up and might not want to spend so much time with his family any more,2.977,15.865,19.041,2,Be grateful her house is being cleaned for free.,41.607,41.607,43.835,1,Start applying for other jobs.,1.527,13.119,14.774,2,Concentrate on her outside-work friends and colleagues from previous jobs.,9.95,9.95,11.148,1,Think that she has been successful in the past and this client being difficult is not her fault.,19.583,19.583,20.668,1,"Invite Blair again, maybe rescheduling for another time.",17.222,17.222,18.157,1,"Make sure she keeps in contact through email, phone or letter writing.",18.195,18.195,19.625,1,Explain the lack of resources to her boss or to management.,16.289,16.289,18.654,1,Talk to a doctor about what the normal rates of development are.,15.674,15.674,16.863,1,Grumpily accept the changes and do the shifts.,18.129,18.129,19.327,1,"Understand that people change, so move on, but remember the good times.",15.758,17.502,19.395,2,Car,2.962,2.962,25.911,1,animal,2.153,17.647,24.151,4,nature,2.469,2.469,24.788,1,music,2.072,2.072,6.695,1,,3.417,3.417,30.016,1,party,2.203,2.203,13.465,1,friends,6.401,6.401,18.629,1,hunter,1.8,1.8,13.54,1,policeman,6.422,6.422,20.276,1,,1.915,1.915,30.106,1,Bomb,3.754,18.338,19.024,2,witch,6.1,6.1,18.185,1,poison,2.497,2.497,11.158,1,graduation,7.755,7.755,14.544,1,kitchen,9.049,9.049,14.069,1,,10.532,10.532,30.109,1,house,2.947,2.947,7.344,1,shop,2.034,2.034,8.151,1,,2.237,2.237,30.012,1,gun,3.572,3.572,20.234,1,lion,2.253,2.253,17.299,1,46.533,46.533,53.916,1,Participation in art courses increases students creative thinking in their science and technology courses.,61.103,61.103,62.726,1,£117.00,52.151,52.151,59.99,1,"1-D, 2-B, 3-C, 4-A",43.542,43.542,48.693,1,B,8.244,43.652,53.753,3,IEWBNZS,Extremely happy

I told her it was time to brush her teeth before she went to sleep as she was looking drowsy. She leaped off the couch in the living room to where I brought her to the kitchen counter where I brush her teeth. I lifted her up on the counter and put this special brand of toothpaste on her toothbrush.

It is not just cleaning simply as we know it but it is cleaning a particular room. I usually help out my wife here and there to clean but then this cleaning chore has a rather sad story behind it. I have to help my wife clean up our late son's room. He was 2 and he died last year in September and ever since that day his room has remained untouched with no one sleeping there. Neither me nor my wife have felt strong enough to go through his things. The last time I tried to clean up the room I just found myself on the floor crying hysterically. We have to clean up the room and pack all his stuff away as we are now moving to a new place. Standing alone in his room makes me feel overwhelmed and defeated and a huge part of me wishes he would just run up and call me to play with his favourite wooden car. I hold his wooden car and tears escape from my eyes unnoticed and I find myself sobbing terribly. How can something like cleaning trigger me this much. I start packing up all his toys, followed by his shoes and I hold a pair of his size 8 little Jordans and it hits me hard that this little shoes will never be worn again and that breaks my heart to pieces.

If it is a sunny day and my eldest son has taken himself to secondary school we walk. The walk from our house takes about 20 minutes. We walk through a stinky path which has a sewage works on one side and an animal food factory on the other. We will then walk through an industrial estate and through beautiful woodland past a couple of friendly horses and up a ridiculously steep track called the bumpy track. My son and I will often play imagination games, pretending we are magicians, or best friends who have sleepovers and pizza parties together or dragons or many other things. When er reach the top of the hill we have to walk along a busy road which has a narrow pavement and lots of other kids and parents going along to school. There is a street sign that makes us laugh because it is inside a neatly strimmed box hedge with just a little post box bit strimmed out so you can read the street name. It just makes me laugh and I have stopped to take a photo of it before.

Sorry, just before we arrive we walk past the play park. The play park is always domimated by whichever group of kids are the current Year 6 pupils. Every year it changes and they always hang out on the swings. As it is summer it is nearly time for them to be moving on, where they will sing the moving on song and there will not be a dry eye in the house.

People who were also at the park gathered near us to listen and they were so amazed. Our voices rhymed and balanced perfectly with one another. Right there and then a lady came to us offered us a deal to record that song at her studio. We could not believe it and we were so happy. Our lives changed for the better from then.

To walk down the tiny aisle or, more accurately, the strip of red carpet, my beam went from ear to ear. The love of my life was watching me; totally awkward, hands in pocket, wild curls flopping over his face! A life-long disbeliever in marriage. He always said no ceremony or certificate could intensify his existing love for me so why bother? 
But he was the one who finally proposed to me. He knew how much I craved the happiness that I witnessed daily in my parents' 58 years of married joy. He wanted me to have that same feeling. 
And I did! And I still do. Every day. It poured with rain during our ceremony but we emerged to sunshine. It was torrential in the evening but only during our dance to 'Purple Rain'.

I then softened the soil ad flattened it lightly so that I could plant some spinach seeds.  Once flattened I poked holes, about one foot apart so I could place my seeds in the right position to enable the plants to grow and develop as best as possible.  Once the seeds were placed in the holes and covered with soil, I filled the watering can and carefully watered the bed.  I then picked some lettuce and rocket leaves from the plants that I had grown from seed two months ago.  In the patch next to those plants I decided to put in more seeds so that I would have lettuce in another month or so once the existing plants had died.  I carefully washed the salad leaves and them in the salad spinner to remove most of the water.  I placed some of the salad leaves in a polythene bag and put them in the fridge.

I waste my time cooking for hours it seems.  Making the choices of what to cook really drives me mad.  I try and plan my meals and buy what is needed from the supermarket as much as I can.  I work part time and my husband full time therefore most of the cooking and planning is done by myself.  I feel I have a lot of pressure and stress on myself for all this planning of meals and cooking of them of course.  I really need to cook one meal to suit everyone and stick by this plan. this would also prove to be cheaper too.,5.254,5.254,603.175,1,panicked,desire,amused,fantasizing,preoccupied,flirtatious,sceptical,decisive,depressed,contemplative,thoughtful,doubtful,arrogant,preoccupied,hostile,anxious,cautious,interested,reflective,serious,distrustful,indecisive,Contact Wai-Hin and arrange to catch up but also make friends with her replacement.,29.566,29.566,31.492,1,Talk to his boss or the management about it.,26.056,26.056,27.265,1,Make an effort to talk to people and be friendly himself.,10.008,10.008,11.116,1,"He should make the effort to contact them, but also try to meet people in his new city.",20.556,20.556,22.047,1,Spend time listening and getting involved again.,12.593,12.593,13.383,1,Think about the great opportunities this change offers.,18.935,18.935,20.861,1,"Speak to other family to calm herself and find out what is happening, then visit the hospital.",13.6,13.6,16.058,1,"Understand that relationships change, but keep calling him from time to time.",11.66,11.66,13.469,1,Be grateful her house is being cleaned for free.,20.69,20.69,22.514,1,Think of these events as an opportunity for a new start.,17.46,17.46,18.552,1,"Talk to her workmates, try to create social contacts and make friends.",13.016,13.016,14.658,1,Think that she has been successful in the past and this client being difficult is not her fault.,39.495,39.495,40.77,1,"Invite Blair again, maybe rescheduling for another time.",25.205,25.205,26.913,1,"Make sure she keeps in contact through email, phone or letter writing.",10.893,10.893,12.284,1,Document the lack of resources in her progress report,23.657,23.657,25.048,1,Talk to a doctor about what the normal rates of development are.,30.205,30.205,31.562,1,Find out if there is some reasonable explanation for the shift changes.,15.613,15.613,17.936,1,"Understand that people change, so move on, but remember the good times.",14.671,14.671,17.863,1,day,3.236,3.236,7.177,1,sack,3.743,3.743,25.166,1,trap,1.649,1.649,19.04,1,player,3.45,3.45,15.338,1,full,2.416,2.416,22.221,1,can,16.101,16.101,22.34,1,party,10.351,10.351,13.506,1,,2.635,26.002,30.108,3,,2.332,2.332,30.008,1,wonder,17.707,17.707,27.579,1,lawn,2.724,2.724,13.313,1,surf,2.276,2.276,15.537,1,shoe,2.153,2.153,21.642,1,dressing,2.437,2.437,10.875,1,baked,2.471,2.471,5.644,1,time,2.089,2.089,11.445,1,value,1.825,1.825,10.513,1,gift,2.303,2.303,20.374,1,birthday,3.245,3.245,8.616,1,bill,2.672,2.672,25.077,1,Megan,2.159,2.159,5.745,1,53.495,53.495,57.985,1,Participation in art courses increases students creative thinking in their science and technology courses.,62.076,62.076,64.535,1,£117.00,8.671,8.671,10.145,1,"1-D, 2-B, 3-C, 4-A",31.567,31.567,33.475,1,Z,14.989,14.989,51.922,1,"B,Z,W,I,U,S,A",Somewhat happy

I was living with my husband, we hadn't long been married.  We were very much in love.  But my husband teases me something rotten, and takes great pleasure in doing so.  And at this particular time, his thing was making me jump.  He'd 'boo' me often, and it wasn't a big thing, i'd jump a little and we'd laugh.  But one day i decided to get my own back.  I was upstairs, in my daughters bedroom (but i can't remember if she was born yet).  We must have been doing something like painting, because i remember i am in the room and by husband isn't.  But i know he is about to come into the room.  I hear him coming up the stairs.  So i hide behind the door - it wasn't really 'hiding', just stood behind it where he couldn't see me.  Anyway, i was dead chuffed as i don't usually think to tease him, but i was going to.  So i was really looking forward to it.  Anyway, as he steps into the room i jump out from behind the door.  I might have even said ""boo"".  I see what happened it slow motion.  He looked at me, and made this beautiful surpised face.  He squealed.  His shoulders shrugged upwards.  And then, he dropped the two pint glasses of water he was holding.  i didn't realise he would be holding drinks, and certainly did not think he would drop them.  Oh, he jumped out of his skin.  I couldn't breathe for laughing.  he laughed to - he was so surprised at this unusual behaviour from me.

Being able to walk on clean floors gives me security and autonomy about myself. I don't exactly vaccum meticulously, but I do so in a pattern that allows me to finish my task easily. I also make sure to focus on corners especially because they accumulate the most amount of trash. I would say that I'm more focused on cleaning corners than on the open floor.

The first thing I do when doing a load of laundry is collect the dirty laundry. In theory, the dirty laundry should all be in the hamper but anyone with a kid knows this is rarely the case! So when collecting laundry, I’m grabbing the hamper and grabbing dirty laundry from the floor, the bottom of the stairs, hanging on the back of my daughters bedroom door, etc. Once the dirty laundry is collected I make my way to the laundry room in the basement. I load (ie throw) the dirty laundry in the washing machine and add detergent. I don’t separate by colour or anything like that. It all goes in together.

I remember the feeling of excitement in the days leading up to the trip, imagining myself surfing in the clear turquoise waters and exploring the lush tropical landscape. When we arrived, I felt an immediate sense of peace and tranquility. One particular day, we took a guided hike through a dense rain forest area. The sounds of the chirping birds and rustling leaves made me feel like I was in a different world. As we walked deeper into the forest, we came across a waterfall that was simply breathtaking. The sight of it made my heart swell with happiness and I felt like I was in a dream. I remember the warmth of the sun on my skin and the cool mist of the waterfall on my face, while my siblings and I played in the pool of water at its base.
After we left, I felt an immense sense of gratitude for being able to experience such natural beauty and connect with my family in such an amazing setting.

I was really excited on this day because I remember when I was still in high school, I had asked my mom to make my graduation day special because it was a day that marked how hard-working I was towards my studies. I remember some of my family members were there. They all watched me as I walked on stage as my name was being called.

I was selected to participate in an Olympiad along with two other learners who were also among the top three learners in our subject and within our grade 

As we traveled to the event, we engaged in a captivating conversation with our teacher. We explored various topics, with a particular focus on our future careers. It was delightful to share our aspirations and dreams, igniting a sense of excitement and curiosity within us.

During the Olympiad, our team worked exceptionally well together. We formed a strong bond and collaborated seamlessly. The atmosphere was a perfect blend of intense focus and camaraderie. We tackled the challenging problems with enthusiasm, leveraging our individual strengths and providing support to one another.

When the time arrived for the results to be announced, nervous anticipation filled the room. The suspense was palpable as each place was declared. Finally, to our immense joy and surprise, our names were proclaimed as the winners of the competition. It was an extraordinary moment of triumph and validation, rewarding our hard work and dedication.

The sheer elation and satisfaction we experienced were indescribable. We embraced each other, jumping with excitement and exchanging high-fives. The bond we forged during the journey and the victory we achieved together made the entire experience even more unforgettable.

This event holds a special place in my heart as it exemplified the power of teamwork, the joy of learning, and the exhilaration of success.

I sent my uncles to go negotiate for me and it all went well. We celebrated the day with a big braai and invited our friends and relatives.
